kapitel speichern => kackt save structure ab maybe kommt dann wieder header oderso
bieglieux: sometimes header of the saved chapter is in $03 command, instead of $20 as it should be,
           when this happens the length of $20 command is $0E, otherwise it is $02 (always?, rule?),
           we do not rely on it, that's why we are skipping saved chapter data here and not in $20 command
