# Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors &mdash; Savegame File Format Specification

## Document Format
The specification document uses *GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)*. More information on this can be found [here](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

## Structure Definitions
The structure definitions kind of follow the *BinData Ruby Gem* declarations. They should be as readable as pseudo code though.
More information on *BinData* can be found [here](http://bindata.rubyforge.org/manual.html).
